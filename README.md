# NFT DApp using HardHat and NextJS 15

### NFT Minting Project

**NFTs in this project are not real or special**. They are taken from [freepik.com](https://www.freepik.com), a website with  standard digital content. So, these NFTs don't have any real value or uniqueness.

I grabbed 30 NFTs from [freepik.com](https://www.freepik.com) and made 1000 copies (images and matadata) with a Python script. This was just to make sure I had enough for testing during the NFT minting process. The duplicates do not add any value or rarity.

This project focuses specifically on NFT minting functionality.

## Project Logic
1. Create Solidity Smart Contract
2. Deploy Smart Contract to Polygon Amoy Testnet
3. Integrate MetaMask wallet on the website
4. Mint NFT by sending transaction to the deployed Smart Contract
5. Display minted NFT on the website

## Stack

1. Solidity
2. HardHat
3. Polygon Amoy Testnet
4. MetaMask Wallet
5. Alchemy
6. Pinata IPFS
7. NFT ERC721 token
8. Frontend: [NextJS 15](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15-rc) + Tailwind CSS (in progress)
